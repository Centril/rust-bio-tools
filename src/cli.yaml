about: A set of ultra-fast command line utilities for bioinformatics tasks based on Rust-Bio.
subcommands:
  - fastq-split:
      about: Split FASTQ file from STDIN into N chunks.
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@tu-dortmund.de>
      args:
        - chunks:
            required: true
            multiple: true
            help: Chunks to create.
  - bam-depth:
      about: "Print depth of BAM or CRAM file at given positions from STDIN (tab separated: chrom, pos)."
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@tu-dortmund.de>
      args:
        - bam-path:
            required: true
            help: Path to indexed BAM file.
        - max-read-length:
            short: m
            value_name: INT
            help: "Maximum read length to consider. This affects the speed of the involved pileup. Reads longer than this length can be missed when calculating the depth."
